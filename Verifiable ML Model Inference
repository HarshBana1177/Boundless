Step 1: Run Inference in zkApp

# You define the logic in Rust:

fn run_inference(input: Vec<u8>) -> Vec<u8> {
   let model = load_model();
   model.predict(input)
}

# Let’s say your input is:

[0.7, 0.1, 0.2]

And the model is a simple classifier that outputs:

[0, 1]  // e.g., class 1 with high confidence



Step 2: Build Proof-Enabled Binary

risc0 build --release

Output: 
✔️ Compiled zkVM guest binary: ./target/risc0-zkvm/release/run_inference



Step 3: Generate Zero-Knowledge Proof

risc0 prove ./run_inference input.json

Output:
✔️ Inference completed: output = [0, 1]
✔️ Proof generated: ./proof.json


Step 4: Verify the Proof

risc0 verify --receipt ./proof.json

Output:
✔️ Proof verified successfully.


Final Output Summary:

Inference Output: [0, 1]
Proof File: proof.json
Verification Status: ✅ Validated
